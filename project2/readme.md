## Late submission

- I wish to ask for one travel day as I didn't make it on time.

## Env: Win11, Visual Studio 2022, Cmake

- Remind: You may need to put model_fp16.onnx into the folder of exe file in case it can not run.

## Command line input

- User need to input three parameters: relative path including exe file name (.../similar.exe), full path of dataset folder (.../olympus) and image name, keep space among them

- example in my case (win/powershell) : "./similar.exe C:\Users\alvin\Desktop\olympus pic.0345.jpg"

- There are menu to choose once you successfully input the args above.

- Extension and custom design is also listed in the menu.

- Top similar images are shown in new window, with image name shown in terminal
